    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
    <p>In November 1981, Rev. & Mrs. Jarvis & Sharon Crosby, a missionary couple together with their daughter Sarah of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) of the United States of America came to Iloilo to start the ministry. As they settled in the city, the first fellowship was held with around thirty-five (35) people in attendance mostly members of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Churches of the Philippines (CAMACOP).<br>
        <br>
        In June 1982, the first Sunday worship was held at the Crosby’s place with Dr. Paul Alford as the guest speaker, the Vice President of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA) of the USA and the President of the Toccoa Falls Bible College, Florida, USA. In the same year, Ms. Pilar Dapitan, a bible woman together with a couple, Pastor and Mrs. Ely Velasco, Junior Interns of Mt. Apo Alliance Church (MAABC) came to help in the work. At this time the worship services were held in a rented place at Lopez Jaena St. Jaro, Iloilo City.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Iloilo Christian and Missionary Alliance Church (ICMAC) was officially organized on June 19, 1983. All along ICMAC has been blessed by the presence and assistance of the members, staff/workers, para church organizations such as the Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), the Philippine Student Alliance Lay Movement (PSALM), the Navigators and the Medical Ambassadors International.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1987, Rev. and Mrs. Juan Taleon, became the Resident Pastor of the church with the assistance of Ms. Melody Individiado and Nell Jane Pagsuguiron, interns from Ebenezer Bible College and Seminary. Sunday services were temporarily held in a restaurant in a downtown area until a place at River Queen Hotel was rented for approximately five (5) years.
        <br>
        <br>
        On October 2,1991, a church lot (where the present sanctuary is located) was acquired through the efforts of our pioneer missionaries, Rev. & Mrs. Jarvis Crosby and the CAMACOP. Thereafter, the church building was built and on September 20, 1992 it was joyfully dedicated to the Lord.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        1. The Bible is the Word of God and our final authority.<br>
        2. God is one, infinitely perfect, existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Ghost.<br>
        3. Jesus is both God and Man, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, died for our sins, was buried, rose bodily from the dead, is in heaven, and will return to set up His kingdom.<br>
        4. God the Holy Spirit lives in the believer, controls, guides and teaches the believer, and convicts the world.<br>
        5. Man was created in God’s image but man’s sin separated him from God. All men are born with a sinful nature and only Jesus Christ’s sacrifice can provide forgiveness of man’s sin.<br>
        6. Salvation is available in Jesus, His death and resurrection, and believers have eternal life and have become children of God.<br>
        7. There shall be a bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust; the just will be resurrected unto life and the unjust unto judgment.<br>
        8. The Church is all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and have received eternal life. It is their duty to pray, witness, build each other up in the faith, and obey the Great Commission.<br>
        9. All believers need to be filled with the Holy Spirit after they are saved. This is how God gives the believer power for the holy living and effective service.<br>
        10.Salvation Jesus provided for physical healing and we anoint with oil in Jesus’ name for healing today.<br>
        11.The soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ is a practical truth that needs to be preached, showing its relation to the personal life and service of the believer.</p><br>
